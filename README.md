# The Foosball App

### The Scenario
Employees at Simpli.fi are pretty fanatical about playing foosball. At any given time during the work day, howls of frustration and triumph can be heard from the Simpli.fi game room.

However, starting games can be a problem. Going around the office asking individuals to play is time consuming and annoying. Also, there is no good way to know if a game is already in progress without walking to the far end of the office to check. Most importantly, there is constant debate over who are the best players.


### The Challenge
Build the front-end of a web app based on the attached designs that will help coordinate games and keep track of player records.

### Requirements
* Use the Bootstrap framework 
* Build a "Standings" view. Read the `foosball_players.json` file and return a table of each player and display the following data points:
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Wins
  * Losses
  * Last Played
* Build views for starting a game and logging victories. 
  * Each game has two teams, two players per team.
  * A “victory” is defined as winning a best-of-three set of games. 
* Reference the included Figma designs for functionality

### Stretch Goals
* Using `Wins` and `Losses` calculate `Win percentage` and make that a column in the table
* Make each column sortable.
